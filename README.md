-   2 Change directory into the root of the project.
-   3 Build:
    -   3.1 Development
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build`
    -   3.2 Production
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build`
-   4 Run
    -   4.1 Development
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
    -   4.2 Production
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`

#### Step by step for local:
-   1 Clone this repository.
-   2 Change directory into the root of the project.
-   3 Install
    `yarn`
    or
    `yarn install`
    or
    `npm install`
-   4 Build:
    -   4.1 Development
        (no need to build)
    -   4.2 Production
        `yarn build`
        or
        `npm run build`
-   5 Run
    -   5.1 Development
        `yarn dev`

        `npm run dev`
    -   5.2 Production
        `yarn start`
        or
        `npm run start`

### Configuration

Change the configuration by modifying the file:
- Development: `.env.development`
- Production: `.env.production`
Config Google API KEY by replace `GOOGLE_API_KEY` variable in [.env](#configuration) file.
To ensure the security of the production environment, you should copy the file `.env.production` to `.env.local` or `.env.production.local`, Git will ignore these files.

## Database Setup

#### Setting Database
-   Docker: database is configured in `docker-compose.dev.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`
-   Local: please install [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) on local computer or use cloud service
Change database connection information by changing `MONGODB_URI` variable in [.env](#configuration) file. In case of using docker-compose, change this value in the file `docker-compose.dev.yml` or `docker-compose.prod.yml`

#### Running migrations
The application can run without data migration. Or you can run cypress test for development environment, data will be automatically deleted and added during testing.

To backup and restore data please refer [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/backup-and-restore-tools/)

## Running the Application

#### Step by step for docker:
-   Run
    -   Development
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
    -   Production
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`

#### Step by step for local:

-   Build:
    -   Development
        (no need to build)
    -   Production
        `yarn build`
        or
        `npm run build`
-   Run
    -   Development
        `yarn dev`
        or
        `npm run dev`
    -   Production
        `yarn start`
        or
        `npm run start`

-   Test:
    -   Start server and test: `yarn start:e2e`
    -   Start server and test (command line only): `yarn start:e2e:headless`

-   Test separately, need to launch server before:
    - Test: `yarn e2e`
    - Test (command line only): `yarn e2e:headless`
**This end-to-end test is aimed at the development environment, it will change the data in the database. Please do not use in stable environment.**
